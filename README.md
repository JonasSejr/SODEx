# SODEx
This repo contains a python implementation of Surrogate Object Detection Explainer (SODEx) published in MDPI.

The original source code is a part of a larger project and only the raw algorithms has currently been moved to this repository.

A full environment with tests code, object extractor and result visualization will be supplied later.
